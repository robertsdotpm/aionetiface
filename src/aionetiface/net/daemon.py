When you're writing server code you are constantly restarting
the process and making changes. This can lead to processes
staying open / lingering in the background that are still listening
on the same port. When doing hacks to reuse ports rapidly for
testing it can lead to very unexpected behavior. Like the
background server (that you don't realize still exists) ends
up stealing all the packets and then you waste hours wndering
why your networking code isn't working.
