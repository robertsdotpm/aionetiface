"""
You're supposed to have unique [src ip, src port, dest ip, dest port] 'tuples' for every end point but you can easily bypass this with UDP. But if you end up with multiple 'sockets' bound to the same endpoint then the OS is not going to route packets correctly. It might make sense to detect this somehow if debug mode is on and show a warning if such actions are detected.

There is also the case where you open a second socket with
the same endpoint and fail to track the state of the first
(and properly close it) which will cause messages to be
routed to the first socket and / or second. It will be
very hard to detect. Sockets need to be properly cleaned
up to avoid this error state.
