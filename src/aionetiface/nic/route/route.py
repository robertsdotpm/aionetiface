"""
This is my attempt to visualize the association between private, NIC
addresses and public WAN addresses on a network interface. I have
learned the following information about network addresses:
 
    * A NIC can have one or more addresses.
    * A NIC can be assigned a block or range of addresses.
    * A NIC doesn't have to use private addresses. It's common for
    server hosts to assign the external addresses that belong
    to the server in such a way that they are used by the NIC.
    In such a case: the NICs addresses would be the same as
    how it was viewed from the external Internet.
    * A NIC can use public addresses that it doesn't own on
    the Internet. This is very bad because it means that these
    addresses will be unreachable on the Internet on that machine.
    NICs should ideally use private addresses. Or stick to IPs
    they actually can route to themselves on the Internet.
    * A NIC defines a "default" gateway to route packets to
    the Internet (which is given by network 0.0.0.0 in IPv4.)
    " The NIC can actually specify multiple default gateways.
    Each entry is a route in the route table. It will have a
    'metric' indicates its 'speed.' The route with the
    the lowest metric is chosen to route packets. TCP/IP may
    adjust the metric of routes based on network conditions.
    Thus, if there are multiple gateways for a NIC then its
    possible for the external WAN address to change under
    high network load. This is not really ideal.
 
The purpose of this module is to have easy access to the
external addresses of the machine and any associated NIC
addresses needed for Bind calls in order to use them. I
use the following simple rules to make this possible:
 
    1. All private addresses for a NIC form a group. This
    group points to the same external address for that NIC.
    2. Any public addresses are tested using STUN. If STUN
    sees the same result as the public address then the
    address is considered public and forms its own route.
    If STUN reports a different result then the address is
    being improperly used for a private NIC address. It
    thus gets added to the private group in step 1.
    3. If there is a block of public addresses to check
    only the first address is checked. If success then
    I assume the whole block is valid. Ranges of
    addresses are fully supported.
 
When it comes to complex routing tables that have
strange setups with multiple default gateways for
a NIC I am for now ignoring this possibility. I
don't consider myself an expert on networking (its
much more complex than it appears) but to directly
leverage routes in a routing table seems to me that
it would require having to work on the ethernet layer.
Something much more painful than regular sockets.

One last thing to note about routing tables: there is
a flag portion that indicates whether a route is 'up.'
If this means 'online' and 'reachable' it would be
really useful to check this to determine if a stack
supported IPv6 or IPv4 rather than trying to test it
first using STUN and waiting for a long time out.

Other:
When it comes to IPs assigned to a NIC its possible
to assign 'public' IPs to it directly. You often
see this setup on servers. In this case you know
that not only can you use the public addresses
directly in bind() calls -- but you know that
the server's corresponding external IP will be
what was used in the bind() call. Very useful.

The trouble is that network interfaces happily
accept 'external IPs' or IPs outside of the
typical 'private IP' range for use on a NIC or
LAN network. Obviously this is a very bad idea
but in the software it has the result of
potentially assuming that an IP would end up
resulting in a particular external IP being used.

The situation is not desirable when building
a picture of a network's basic routing makeup.
I've thought about the problem and I don't see
a way to solve it other than to measure how a
route's external address is perceived from the
outside world. Such a solution is not ideal but
at least it only has to be done once.
