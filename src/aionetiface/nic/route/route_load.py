"""
Network interface cards have a list of addresses to bind on them. 
They consist of one or more ranges of IPs. A range may have one IP in it.
Depending on the gateway and route tables -- binding to any of those IPs
ends up with a certain public address from another machines perspective on
the Internet. To discover that perspective -- STUN is used.

However, since public STUN servers are used a portion of them may be adversarial
(or simply misconfigured to return bad results.) So this function allows for
public addresses to be discovered assuming that a minimum number of STUN
servers report the same result. It is optimized so that if there are ranges
of IPs for a NIC (with a million IPs for example) -- it only checks the
first address to learn an associated IP and then generalized the result.

Servers often like to directly set public addresses for their NIC cards
to indicate that they're directly connected to the Internet without NATs
or any of that junk. In that case -- the software still checks if these are
valid addresses because a machine is free to set whatever addresses they like
for their interface but it doesn't mean that the addresses are valid.
